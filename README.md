## Overview

A honeypot is a security mechanism set to detect, deflect, or study attempts at unauthorized use of information systems. This project aims to provide an easy-to-deploy honeypot system, primarily using Python, that can be used by security researchers and developers to:

- Monitor attacks
- Collect data on attack vectors
- Analyze malicious behavior

## Features

- **Python-based honeypot server:** Simulates vulnerable services to attract attackers
- **Logging and alerting:** Captures access attempts and logs details for analysis
- **HTML dashboard:** (if included) View and interact with collected data through a web interface
- **Configurable:** Customize the types of services and ports exposed

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/pavanreddyx7/honeypot-project.git
   cd honeypot-project
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   *(Make sure to update `requirements.txt` with all necessary Python packages.)*

## Usage

1. **Start the honeypot server:**
   ```bash
   python honeypot.py
   ```

2. **Access the dashboard (if available):**
   Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:PORT` (replace `PORT` with the configured port).

3. **Logs and data:**
   - Logs are saved in the `logs/` directory (or the configured log path).
   - Analyze the logs to study attack attempts and patterns.

> **Warning:** Do NOT run this honeypot on production systems or networks with sensitive data. Always use isolated or controlled environments.
